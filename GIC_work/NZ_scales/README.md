# NZ GMD Scale Investigations

These input files are designed to investigate the spatial and temporal scales
of GMDs over the New Zealand land mass over a range of storm inputs.

Inputs are based on the *Katus et al. * SEA analysis, scaled up for extreme
storms.

PARAMs are based on the CUSIA Phase 1 idealized events.
