These runfiles are specifically for simulations that will act as inputs to the
Whole Atmopshere Model (WAM).  The project specifically calls for geospace
inputs to WAM as generated by the SWMF.

The requirements on the inputs are as follows:

--Ionospheric electric fields
--Field output must go to equator
--60s output frequency
--If possible, get E parallel and perpendicular to B.
--Work to get electric fields to lowest latitudes possible.

Most PARAMs are based on the SWPC high-res version.  Changes include:

--removal of non-necessary operational options such as refresh solar wind.
--Updated, useful magnetometer grids.
--Lowered latitude boundary of IE.
--Updated GM output to 60s, use MHD and ray output files.
